<h3>Declaration of Intent:</h3>
<p>As an experienced astronaut with a passion for exploring the depths of space, I am thrilled to have the opportunity to participate in the new space project by the ExtraTerrestrial Colonies Agency (ETCA). Having dedicated over a decade to working in open space, asteroids, and the Moon and Mars orbits, my enthusiasm for pushing the boundaries of human exploration has only grown stronger. I firmly believe that this new project will pave the way for the future of interplanetary colonization and I am eager to contribute my expertise and skills towards its success.</p>

<h3>Experience:</h3>
<h4>Construction and Maintenance Specialist - Solstice Space Station (Earth Orbit)</h4>
<p>During my tenure as a Construction and Maintenance Specialist at the Solstice Space Station, I have honed my skills in construction and maintenance, ensuring the smooth operations of the station. With a deep understanding of the intricacies of space infrastructure, I have been responsible for maintaining critical life-support systems, conducting repairs on external structures, and overseeing the installation of advanced equipment. My meticulous attention to detail and problem-solving abilities have been instrumental in preventing potential disasters and ensuring the safety of the crew.</p>

<h4>Astronomical Resource Analyst - Red Horizon Mining Corporation (Asteroid Belt)</h4>
<p>As an Astronomical Resource Analyst at Red Horizon Mining Corporation, I have been at the forefront of extracting valuable resources from asteroids within the Belt. Collaborating closely with a diverse team of scientists and engineers, my role has involved analyzing asteroid composition, determining their resource potential, and strategizing mining operations. Through effective teamwork and coordination, we have successfully executed numerous missions, contributing to the expansion of resource availability for human colonies across the solar system.</p>

<h4>Lunar Geologist - Artemis Research Outpost (Moon)</h4>
<p>During my time as a Lunar Geologist at the Artemis Research Outpost, my passion for astrogeology has been central to my work. Conducting extensive research on lunar formations, I have contributed to our understanding of the Moon's geological history and identified potential sites for future lunar bases. In addition, I have actively participated in the construction and maintenance of essential infrastructure, ensuring the sustainability of our operations on the lunar surface.</p>

<h4>Martian Orbital Engineer - Olympus Space Station (Mars Orbit)</h4>
<p>Serving as a Martian Orbital Engineer at the Olympus Space Station, I have had the privilege of witnessing the remarkable progress in Martian colonization efforts. In this capacity, I have been involved in overseeing the construction and maintenance of the Mars orbital infrastructure, playing a crucial role in facilitating the transportation of resources and personnel between the Martian surface and the Olympus Space Station.
